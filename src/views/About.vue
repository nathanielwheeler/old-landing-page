				I am a knowledge sponge who isn’t content unless I am learning or puzzling over something.
				<br />Before I was a developer, I was an art student, a geology major, a calculus tutor, a bookkeeper, and even a coroner’s assistant.
				<br />When I’m not working on projects or looking at documentation, I like to make comics, read some good ol’ scifi/fantasy, and partake in outdoor activities.
				<br />I live in Boise, Idaho with my wife and our two cats.
